			This is a piece about introspection and the various voices that we might hear in our minds. These voices might come from ourselves or from people we have met. They might even be figments of our imagination, but regardless, we hear them. Sometimes these voices can be loud, and at other times, they are barely whispers, yet we are still able to hear them. Sometimes these voices are demeaning and critical, and on ocassion, they are uplifting and positive. Sometimes these voices can be overwhelming, and no matter how hard we try, we can not shut them out, but if we actually manage to, the voices will come back again.</p>	

			<p class="content">These voices echo and reverberate inside our skulls. </p>
 
		<p class="content">We are our own worst critics.</p>

		<p class="content">I wanted to make a piece that was relatable to anyone who hears and watches it. Every single individual is on a different level of openness about their feelings and thoughts, so I made this piece with the people who find it difficult to express their true thoughts and feelings in mind.</p>

		<p class="content">I used to be a very private person and found it difficult to talk about personal things, and so, I bottled my feelings up. I did not know that it was unhealthy to do that until my friend pointed it out and got upset with me for not opening up. At the time, it was still difficult for me to express my feelings. I was in denial. However, from my own experience, I found that listening or seeing things that were similar to my situation and that I could relate to helped me work through my problems, and eventually open up.</p>

		<p class="content">I think it is important to face difficult situations, and process them at our own pace, whether it be having a verbal conversation with someone or just thinking about it. This is what I hope people take away from the piece.</p>

		<p class="content">Audio was mixed in 5.1 surround sound in Adobe Premiere.

	<h1>Project 2: Reverb Video/ Visual</h1>

		<p class="content">For Project 2, I created a video that is meant to complement the audio. There are shots of clocks moving, a view of looking out the window and watching cars/ people pass by, and two different angles of a candle. Because the audio is meant to be the most important part, I shot video of things that are not too distracting. The visuals are meant to create a sense of contemplation and meditation. Unlike most videos where the audio enhances the video, I wanted to make a video where the visuals enhance the audio; or at least, allows the viewer to self-reflect. 
			
		</p>

		<p class="content"> I tried to capture video and visuals that can be both calming/ relaxing to look at, yet anxiety inducing. I understand that everyone has a different reaction to <em>Reverb</em>. It was interesting to hear that most people felt uncomfortable and emotional when listening and watching the video, but there were a couple people who felt that it was very relatable and relieving. These few people told me that they felt a sense of belonging and that they were not alone in having these kinds of thoughts. The dichotomy and variations in experiences is what is the most interesting to me. 

		</p>

		<p class="content">With <em>Reverb</em> I wanted to create an experience, and not something tangible. I wanted to create something relatable that people can hopefully relate to and find their own peace in whatever they are stuggling with.

		<p class="content">Video was shot with a Panasonic Lumix G7 mirrorless camera on a tripod, edited in Adobe Premiere, and uploaded to Vimeo.

			<a href="https://queenasitu.github.io/art_107_proj3/"><u>Link to the website.</u></a>
		</p>

		<p class="content">This is the third project in our class. I wanted to expand on my Javascript skills since I am just a beginner. I made a website that is interactive. You can click on the buttons and listen to the audio play on loop. The idea is that the more you click on the buttons, the more voices will overlap each other. Eventually you will just hear the audios play over each other at the same time. With this project, I wanted to be more general on the idea of "thought process." For example, how would you navigate the site and choose which one to click first? Are your decisions based on shape? Color? The words on the buttons? Or perhaps, the placement of the objects is what helps you make the decision.  
			
		</p>

		<p class="content">The audio is related to <em>Reverb</em> in the way that they are more self-critical thoughts that I gathered from an input box in the galleries. I wanted to gain more feedback and input from visitors so during our class show, I put a box with paper that people can write on and slip their answers to, "Do you have any negative or self-critical thoughts you wish to part with?"   
			
		</p>

		<p class="content">The website was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript; specifically, P5.js.
