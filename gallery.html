This is a piece about introspection and the various voices that we might hear in our minds. These voices might come from ourselves or from people we have met. They might even be figments of our imagination, but regardless, we hear them. Sometimes these voices can be loud, and at other times, they are barely whispers, yet we are still able to hear them. Sometimes these voices are demeaning and critical, and on ocassion, they are uplifting and positive. Sometimes these voices can be overwhelming, and no matter how hard we try, we can not shut them out, but if we actually manage to, the voices will come back again.</p>	
 
<p class="content">We are our own worst critics.</p>

<p class="content">I wanted to make a piece that was relatable to anyone who hears and watches it. Every single individual is on a different level of openness about their feelings and thoughts, so I made this piece with the people who find it difficult to express their true thoughts and feelings in mind.</p>

<p class="content">I used to be a very private person and found it difficult to talk about personal things, and so, I bottled my feelings up. I did not know that it was unhealthy to do that until my friend pointed it out and got upset with me for not opening up. At the time, it was still difficult for me to express my feelings. I was in denial. However, from my own experience, I found that listening or seeing things that were similar to my situation and that I could relate to helped me work through my problems, and eventually open up.</p>

<p class="content">I think it is important to face difficult situations, and process them at our own pace, whether it be having a verbal conversation with someone or just thinking about it. This is what I hope people take away from the piece.</p>
